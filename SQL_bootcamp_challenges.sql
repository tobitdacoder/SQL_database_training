-- CHALLENGE ONE

SELECT first_name,last_name
FROM hcm.employees;  -- this code here will select all the records in 
                     -- the column first_name and last_name

SELECT first_name,last_name, coalesce(state_province,'N/A') as 	State_province
FROM hcm.employees;

-- CHALLENGE TWO

SELECT last_name AS customer_last_name,city
FROM hcm.employees;

-- here e are using the AS keyword to return a renamed field.

-- CHALLENGE THREE

SELECT *
FROM oes.order_items;
-- this * specifies that we want to return all the columns in the table

-- CHALLENGE FOUR

SELECT DISTINCT locality
FROM bird.antarctic_populations;
-- this will basically return all the localities (distinct localities), and that is done by using the DISTINCT clause.

-- CHALLENGE SIX

SELECT employee_id,first_name,hire_date
FROM hcm.employees
ORDER BY hire_date DESC; -- this will make sure to order from the most rescent hired employee to the less recent one.
						 -- here, later dates are greater dates.
